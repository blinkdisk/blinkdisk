## Features

### 🔒 End-to-End Encrypted

Your files, your eyes only. All backups are encrypted before they ever leave your device. Not even we can read your data, and that's how it should be.

### 🙌 User-Friendly

BlinkDisk is built to feel invisible. Set it up once, and it quietly backs up your files in the background. No distractions, no decisions.

### 🚀 Simple Setup

Get started in minutes, no tech stills needed. BlinkDisk works out of the box, whether you're bringing your own S3 keys or using BlinkDisk Cloud.

### 🌍 Cross-Platform

Whether you're on macOS, Windows, or Linux, BlinkDisk keeps your files safe and synced seamlessly across all your machines.
